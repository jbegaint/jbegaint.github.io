Abstract Deep neural networks have been recently proposed to solve video interpolation tasks. Given a past and future frame, such networks can be trained to successfully predict the intermediate frame(s). In the context of video compression, these architectures could be useful as an additional inter-prediction mode. Current inter-prediction methods rely on block-matching techniques to estimate the motion between consecutive frames.</description>

Abstract Video codecs are primarily designed assuming that rigid, block-based, two-dimensional displacements are suitable models to describe the motion taking place in a scene. However, translational models are not sufficient to handle real world motion types such as camera zoom, shake, pan, shearing or changes in aspect ratio. We present here a region-based inter- prediction scheme to compensate such motion.</description>

      <title>Region-Based Prediction for Image Compression in the Cloud</title>

      <description>Authors Jean Bégaint, Dominique Thoreau, Philippe Guillotel and Christine Guillemot
Abstract Thanks to the increasing number of images stored in the cloud, external image similarities can be leveraged to efficiently compress images by exploiting inter-images correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel image prediction scheme for cloud storage. Unlike current state-of-the-art methods, we use a semi-local approach to exploit inter-image correlation. The reference image is first segmented into multiple planar regions determined from matched local features and super-pixels.</description>

Abstract Thanks to the increasing number of images stored in the cloud, external image redundancies can be leveraged to efficiently compress images by exploiting inter-images correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based image coding scheme. Unlike current state-of-the-art systems, our method relies on a data dimensionality reduction technique. A global compensation is associated to a locally-weighted template matching compensation method to predict a reference frame, to be then differential-coded with classic video coding tools.</description>
