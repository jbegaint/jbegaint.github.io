      <description> This thesis aims at exploring novel approaches for improving current inter-prediction methods. Such methods leverage redundancies between similar frames, and were originally developed in the context of video compression. Applications such as images set compression (photo albums, cloud databases) and video compression were considered. The last part of the thesis focuses on deep learning approaches for inter-prediction.
